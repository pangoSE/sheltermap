# sheltermap
This is a very simple slippy map website that loads shelters from the crowdsourced geodatabase [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/) (OSM) via [Overpass-Turbo](https://www.overpass-turbo.eu/) and displays the information. It tries to display any images found so you can plan your use of the shelters and amenities. 

The map is *not* mobile friendly. I encourage you to try out [OsmAnd](https://github.com/osmandapp/Osmand) on mobile devices instead which makes it easy to view and filter OSM features and which also supports loading pictures from Wikimedia Commons and Mapillary just like this sheltermap.

*Note the permalink in the bottom left corner that makes it possible to share the position with others and the possiblity of downloading a GPX-file with the data by following the link in the bottom right corner.*
