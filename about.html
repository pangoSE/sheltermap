<div>This map was made by pangoSE in 2020.<br />
It works by fetching data from the overpass-api.de webservice when the user press "Load POIs". Note that the API has a quite strict rate limiting regime, so wait a minute between loads. Check the browser console to see any errors.<br />
  Thanks to Github for hosting and to overpass-api for a fantastic service.</br>
